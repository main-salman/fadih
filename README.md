**Total infrastructure-wide anonymity achieved.**

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite, shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy, MySQL database
- **Storage**: Exoscale S3 for document storage
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for cloud deployment on Exoscale
- **Authentication**: JWT-based admin authentication
- **Package Managers**: `yarn` (frontend), `uv` (backend)

## Local Development

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
make
```

2. Start the backend and frontend servers in separate terminals:

```bash
make run-backend
make run-frontend
```

The backend server runs on port 8000 and the frontend development server runs on port 5173. The frontend Vite server proxies API requests to the backend on port 8000.

Visit <http://localhost:5173> to view the application.

## Production Deployment

This project is deployed on Exoscale cloud infrastructure using Terraform with **complete privacy compliance**:

- **Live Site**: http://159.100.250.145 *(Privacy-compliant, no IP tracking)*
- **API Documentation**: http://159.100.250.145/api/docs
- **Admin Login**: http://159.100.250.145/admin-login-page

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Deploy to production server (includes privacy configurations)
./deploy.sh

# Run locally with production-like setup
./run-local.sh
```

The deployment process automatically configures:
- ‚úÖ **Privacy-compliant nginx logs** without IP addresses
- ‚úÖ **System log filtering** to prevent IP storage  
- ‚úÖ **Anonymous rate limiting** and security measures
- ‚úÖ **Database migration** to remove all IP data
- ‚úÖ **Complete anonymity infrastructure** for whistleblowers
