   - All 9 resources will be created: security groups, SSH key, elastic IP, compute instance, dbaas
   - Database connection information properly passed to cloud-init template
   - Ready for terraform apply with user's API credentials

4. **SSH Access Resolution (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Identified password confusion: Multiple passwords in config for different purposes
