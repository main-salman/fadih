1. **Frontend Not Deploying**: Server was serving old frontend build with "Databutton" title
2. **No Version System**: No way to track app versions and deployments
3. **Build Configuration Issues**: Vite config still had old Databutton references and localhost API URLs

**Solutions Applied:**
1. **Version Management System (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Updated frontend/package.json from version "0.0.0" to "1.1.0"
   - Created frontend/src/components/Version.tsx component that reads version from package.json
   - Added version display to footer of main App.tsx: "© 2025 Fadih.org. All rights reserved. v1.1.0"
   - Version automatically updates from package.json during build process

2. **Automatic Version Increment Script (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Created update-version.sh script for automatic version management
   - Supports patch, minor, and major version increments
   - Handles special case: version 1.100 automatically becomes 2.1.0
   - Script usage: `./update-version.sh [patch|minor|major]` (default: patch)
   - Creates backup of package.json and shows diff of changes

3. **Fixed Frontend Build Configuration (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Updated vite.config.ts: Changed app title from "Databutton" to "Fadih.org"
   - Fixed API URLs: Changed from localhost to production server (159.100.250.145)
   - Frontend now builds with correct configuration for production deployment

4. **Comprehensive Deployment Script (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Created deploy.sh script that handles complete deployment workflow
   - Process: Version Update → Local Build → Git Commit → Git Push → Server Deployment
   - Automatically increments version, builds frontend, commits changes, and deploys to server
   - Script usage: `./deploy.sh [patch|minor|major]` for full deployment
   - Includes error handling and deployment verification

5. **Frontend Deployment Fix (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Fixed nginx configuration to serve frontend properly
   - Updated deployment process to copy built files to /var/www/html/
   - Added proper cache-busting headers to ensure updates are visible
   - Server now properly serves updated frontend builds

**Technical Implementation:**
- Version component dynamically reads from package.json during build
- JSON imports properly configured in Vite for version access
- Production builds use correct API endpoints (159.100.250.145)
- Nginx configured to serve static files with API proxy
- Deployment script handles complete end-to-end process

**Version Increment Examples:**
- Patch: 1.1.0 → 1.1.1 → 1.1.2 → ... → 1.1.100 → 2.1.0
- Minor: 1.1.5 → 1.2.0 (resets patch to 0)
- Major: 1.5.3 → 2.1.0 (resets minor to 1, patch to 0)
- Special: 1.100.0 → 2.1.0 (automatic major increment)

**Deployment Workflow:**
```bash
# Increment version and deploy
./deploy.sh patch    # 1.1.0 → 1.1.1
./deploy.sh minor    # 1.1.5 → 1.2.0  
./deploy.sh major    # 1.5.3 → 2.1.0

# Or just update version without deploying
./update-version.sh patch
```

**Current Status:**
✅ **Version System**: v1.1.1 displayed in footer, automatic increment working
✅ **Frontend Deployment**: Proper builds deploying to server, title fixed to "Fadih.org"
✅ **Build Configuration**: Production API URLs, correct app title and settings
✅ **Deployment Automation**: Complete workflow from version update to production
