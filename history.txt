   - Ready for deployment with user's Exoscale API credentials 

#### Terraform Provider Issues Fixed (COMPLETED ✅)
1. **Updated Exoscale Provider Configuration**:
   - Updated provider version from 0.59 to 0.62+ (using latest 0.64.3)
   - Fixed deprecated resource names: exoscale_database → exoscale_dbaas
   - Removed unsupported resources: exoscale_compute_template, exoscale_elastic_ip_attachment
   - Used hardcoded Ubuntu 24.04 LTS template ID instead of data source

2. **Database Configuration Fixes**:
   - Added required mysql {} configuration block for exoscale_dbaas resource
   - Implemented data source pattern: data.exoscale_database_uri for connection info
   - Fixed all database connection attributes to use data source instead of direct resource access

3. **Compute Instance Updates**:
   - Fixed elastic IP attachment using elastic_ip_ids parameter instead of separate resource
   - Updated ssh_key parameter to ssh_keys array format (deprecation fix)
   - Ensured all security group and network configurations are compatible

4. **Configuration Validation**:
   - Terraform plan now runs successfully without errors
   - All 9 resources will be created: security groups, SSH key, elastic IP, compute instance, dbaas
   - Database connection information properly passed to cloud-init template
   - Ready for terraform apply with user's API credentials

4. **SSH Access Resolution (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Identified password confusion: Multiple passwords in config for different purposes
   - admin_password = "freepalestine" (application admin, NOT system login)
   - mysql_password = "***REMOVED***" (database access)
   - Console password = "***REMOVED***" (system login from Exoscale console)
   - SOLUTION: SSH key authentication works for ROOT USER (not ubuntu user)
   - Successfully connected: ssh root@159.100.250.145 (no password needed)
   - Server accessible via web (nginx running) at 159.100.250.145

#### Current Status (SSH ACCESS WORKING ✅):

#### Deployment Issues Resolved (COMPLETED ✅):
**Problem:** Application deployment was getting stuck and failing due to multiple issues:
1. Import path errors in authentication API
2. FastAPI dependency annotation conflicts
3. Database connection timeouts causing startup failures
4. Missing frontend build directory causing 502 errors
5. Incorrect nginx configuration

**Solutions Applied:**

1. **Fixed Import Path Error (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Corrected import in backend/app/apis/auth/__init__.py
   - Changed `from ..auth.jwt_auth` to `from ...auth.jwt_auth` (correct relative import)
   - This resolved the "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.apis.auth.jwt_auth'" error

2. **Fixed FastAPI Depends Annotation Conflicts (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Resolved "Cannot specify `Depends` in `Annotated` and default value together" error
   - Fixed parameter order in document_processing API endpoints
   - Ensured AdminUser annotations work correctly with FastAPI dependency system

3. **Made Database Initialization Resilient (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Changed database connection timeout from blocking to non-blocking
   - Modified startup event to log warning instead of crashing when database unavailable
   - Added connection timeouts (10 seconds) to MySQL engine configuration
   - Application now starts successfully even if database is temporarily unavailable

4. **Fixed Frontend/Nginx Configuration (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Created temporary frontend page with API documentation links
   - Updated nginx configuration from proxy mode to static file serving
   - Fixed nginx to serve from /opt/foi-archive/frontend/dist instead of proxying to port 3000
   - Resolved 502 Bad Gateway errors

5. **Service Configuration Fixed (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Corrected systemd service to use uvicorn properly
   - Changed ExecStart from `python main.py` to `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
   - Service now starts successfully and listens on port 8000
