### Translation Database Population Fix (COMPLETED ✅)
**Date:** Current session - Issue Resolution
**Problem:** Admin translation interface showing "No translations found" for all languages except English

**Root Cause Identified:**
- Translation table was created successfully but only contained initial English translations
- Frontend JSON files (ar.json, fr.json, de.json, ru.json) were not loaded into database
- Admin interface relies on database content, not frontend JSON files

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Translation Population Script (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Created `backend/populate_translations.py` comprehensive population script
   - Loads all 5 language JSON files from frontend/src/i18n/locales/
   - Flattens nested JSON structure (e.g., navigation.search, homepage.title)
   - Determines appropriate sections automatically from translation keys
   - Handles Unicode characters properly for Arabic, Russian, etc.

2. **Database Population (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Successfully populated 535 total translations:
     * Arabic (AR): 107 translations
     * German (DE): 107 translations  
     * English (EN): 107 translations
     * French (FR): 107 translations
     * Russian (RU): 107 translations
   - Used INSERT/UPDATE strategy to handle existing translations
   - Preserved system migration translations while replacing script-generated ones

3. **API Verification (COMPLETED ✅)**:
   - Arabic API: ✅ Returning proper Arabic text (بحث, رفع, الخصوصية مضمونة)
   - French API: ✅ Returning proper French text (Rechercher, Télécharger, Confidentialité Garantie)
   - All language endpoints tested and functional
   - Admin interface now has access to complete translation database

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Script Features**: JSON flattening, section detection, Unicode support, error handling
- **Database Strategy**: MySQL INSERT ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE for safe population  
- **Language Support**: Full character set support for Arabic RTL and Cyrillic Russian
- **Section Organization**: Automatic categorization into navigation, homepage, search, upload, privacy, general

**Current Status:**
- **Database**: ✅ 535 translations across 5 languages successfully populated
- **API Endpoints**: ✅ All public translation endpoints returning correct data
- **Admin Interface**: ✅ Translation management now has access to all language data
- **Character Encoding**: ✅ Proper Unicode support for Arabic and Russian text

**Result:**
🎉 **TRANSLATION DATABASE SUCCESS** - Admin translation interface now shows complete translations for all languages:
- ✅ **Arabic Navigation**: بحث (Search), رفع (Upload), الخصوصية مضمونة (Privacy Guaranteed)
- ✅ **French Navigation**: Rechercher, Télécharger, Confidentialité Garantie
- ✅ **German Navigation**: Suchen, Hochladen, Datenschutz Garantiert  
- ✅ **Russian Navigation**: Поиск, Загрузить, Конфиденциальность Гарантирована
- ✅ **Complete Coverage**: All 107 translation keys available in all 5 languages

The admin interface no longer shows "No translations found" and administrators can now manage translations for all supported languages through the web interface.

## Database Connectivity Resolution (v1.1.16) - July 16, 2025

### Issue Identified:
- **External Database Failure**: External Aiven/Exoscale cloud database hostname `***REMOVED***` failing DNS resolution (NXDOMAIN)
- **Service Impact**: Statistics API returning 500 errors, database-dependent features non-functional
- **Root Cause**: External cloud database service likely terminated or hostname changed

### Solution Implemented:
- **Local Database Discovery**: Confirmed MySQL server running locally on production server (159.100.250.145)
- **Database Migration**: Switched from external cloud database to local MySQL instance
- **Configuration Update**: Modified DATABASE_URL from external host to `localhost:3306`
- **User Authentication**: Reset foi_user password to match application configuration
- **Service Restart**: Restarted foi-archive service to pickup new database configuration

### Technical Changes:
```bash
# Database URL Update
OLD: DATABASE_URL=mysql://foi_user:***REMOVED***@***REMOVED***:21699/foi_archive
NEW: DATABASE_URL=mysql://foi_user:***REMOVED***@localhost:3306/foi_archive

# User Password Reset
ALTER USER 'foi_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '***REMOVED***';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### Verification Results:
- ✅ **Database Connection**: Local MySQL connection successful
- ✅ **Statistics API**: http://fadih.salmannaqvi.com:8000/statistics/country-stats returning proper data
- ✅ **Health Endpoint**: http://fadih.salmannaqvi.com:8000/health responding correctly
